    AbstractRegister{B, T}

abstract type that registers will subtype from. `B` is the batch size, `T` is the
data type.

## Required Methods

### Multiply

    *(op, reg)

define how operator `op` act on this register. This is quite useful when
there is a special approach to apply an operator on this register. (e.g
a register with no batch, or a register with a MPS state, etc.)

!!! note

    be careful, generally, operators can only be applied to a register, thus
    we should only overload this operation and do not overload `*(reg, op)`.

### Pack Address

pack `addrs` together to the first k-dimensions.

#### Example

Given a register with dimension `[2, 3, 1, 5, 4]`, we pack `[5, 4]`
to the first 2 dimensions. We will get `[5, 4, 2, 3, 1]`.

### Focus Address

    focus!(reg, range)

merge address in `range` together as one dimension (the active space).

#### Example

Given a register with dimension `(2^4)x3` and address [1, 2, 3, 4], we focus
address `[3, 4]`, will pack `[3, 4]` together and merge them as the active
space. Then we will have a register with size `2^2x(2^2x3)`, and address
`[3, 4, 1, 2]`.

## Initializers

Initializers are functions that provide specific quantum states, e.g zero states,
random states, GHZ states and etc.

    register(::Type{RT}, raw, nbatch)

an general initializer for input raw state array.

    register(::Val{InitMethod}, ::Type{RT}, ::Type{T}, n, nbatch)

init register type `RT` with `InitMethod` type (e.g `Val{:zero}`) with
element type `T` and total number qubits `n` with `nbatch`. This will be
auto-binded to some shortcuts like `zero_state`, `rand_state`.
